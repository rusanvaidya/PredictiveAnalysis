Pandas is a Python package developed for data cleaning and manipulation.
It provides extended data structures to hold different types of labeled
and relational data, which makes it highly flexible and easy to use.

Pandas provides the following two objects on which all its operations are performed:

Series: A 1-dimensional table object

Dataframe: A 2-dimensional table object
